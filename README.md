More fun with flexbox for CodeAcademy

A note on opacity: I applied it in the way I interpreted it from the spec, but I don't think it's very clear. I applied the 0.9 opacity to the main content only - not the header and footer - as it looked like the finished version might have had it applied in that way. I then applied an opacity of 1 to the location boxes, but of course this means they just inherit the opacity of the parent. I'm unclear as to whether this should have been "an opacity of 0.9 on all main content except the location boxes".
